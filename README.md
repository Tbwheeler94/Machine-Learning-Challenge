# Machine-Learning-Challenge

## The best model for this assignment was the Random Forest Classifier with a model score of 0.902. 'koi_fpflag_co', 'koi_fpflag_nt', and 'koi_fpflag_ss' were the most significant columns in determining the exoplanet result. The other classifiers I used were K Nearest Neighbor and SVC which had scores of 0.832 and 0.871 respectively.

## To improve my models' predictive power I would focus on removing data columns that play a minimal role in determining exoplanet outcome
